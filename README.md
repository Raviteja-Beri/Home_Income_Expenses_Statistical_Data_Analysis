## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset includes annual financial information for an individual or household:

- **Year**
- **Income**
- **Expenses** (including categories like Food, Rent, Utilities, Transportation, Healthcare, etc.)
- **Savings**

## 🔍 Exploratory & Statistical Techniques

- Descriptive statistics (`mean`, `median`, `std`, etc.)
- Correlation analysis between income, expenses, and savings.
- Year-over-year trend analysis.
- Line plots, bar charts, and pie charts to represent income and expenses visually.
- Comparison of categories using `matplotlib` and `pandas`.
